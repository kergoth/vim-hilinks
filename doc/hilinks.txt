2. Manual					*hilinks-manual*

MAPS						*hlt*
	\hlt  : reveals a linked list of highlighting from the top-level down
	        to the bottom level for the cursor position.  For vim 7.1
	        with patch 215, will also reveal the syntax stack at the cursor
	        position.

COMMANDS					*:HLT* *:HLT!* *:HLTm*
	:HLT  : same as \hlt, but in a command format.
	:HLT! : same as \hlt, but will execute on every CursorMoved event,
	        so one can see the highlighting trace and syntax stack as
		one moves the cursor.  The next :HLT! will toggle this mode
		off.
		May enable mouse-based balloons, too (see |hilinks-beval|).
	:HLTm : same as :HLT! (provided so AsNeeded can trigger off it)
	:HLTX : like :HLT, but also converts the colors into an xterm-256-color
	        index
	:HLTX!: like :HLT!, but also converts the colors into an xterm-256-color
	        index
	
	NOTE: Vim 7.1 with patch#215 required for the syntax stack.

BEVAL						*hilinks-beval*
	By default and with |:HLT!|, if your vim supports |'beval'|, hilinks will enable
	beval and install a ballon expression (|'bexpr'|).  You can
	prevent that by putting >
		let g:hilinks_nobeval= 1
<	into your .vimrc .

	This feature means that a hovering mouse will show a highlighting
	trace when |:HLT!| is used to enable syntax and highlighting tracing
	as you move the cursor.
